# R Notebook

Welcome to the R Notebook repository. This repository contains various R Markdown (`.rmd`) files for different classes and projects. Below is an overview of the structure and contents of this repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with the R Notebooks in this repository, you will need to have R installed on your machine. Additionally, you may need to install some R packages used in the notebooks.

### Installing Required Packages

Some of the notebooks may require specific R packages. For example, the `ggplot2_study.rmd` file requires the `ggplot2` and `jsonlite` packages. You can install these packages using the following commands in R:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("jsonlite")
```

### Running the Notebooks

You can open and run the .rmd files in RStudio. Simply open the file and click the "Knit" button to generate the output document.
