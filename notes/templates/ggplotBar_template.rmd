### Content Reference:

This lab reference practice problems from *"R for Data Science" - Chapter 3: Data Visualisation* https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html

#### In this lab we will discuss and apply:

* Position Adjustments (for bars)
* Geometric Objects

## Example 1: Diamonds

First, call the tidyverse package
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The `diamonds` dataset is built into the `ggplot2` package.

**Prices of over 50,000 round cut diamonds**

**Description:** A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. The variables are as follows:

```{r}
?diamonds
```

### A. Learn About the Data

What kinds of variables are we working with?

```{r}
# look at the structure of the data

```


### B. Basic Bar Graph

Let's start with a basic bar graph.  This is a univariate graphical tool for the relative frequency of categorical data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut))
```

#### 1. Playing with Color vs Fill

##### Color
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, color = cut)) # provides a different color for each category
```

Does the output of the graphic above match what you imagined?  Why or why not?

##### Fill

Now try changing the aesthetic to fill.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, fill = cut)) # provides a single color for all categories
```

Does this match what you were hoping for?

#### 2. Color Palette

What do you notice about this color palette?

*Hint: How is it different than the following example using the `mpg` dataset: *

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = class, fill = class))
```


### C. Position Adjustment

#### 1. Stacked Bar Graphs

By default, when we use a different variable to add color to a bar graph than the frequency variable, R creates a stacked bar graph

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

* When would it be useful to use a graphic like this?
* When might it not be a good choice?  Why?

#### 2. Filled Bar Graphs

When we are interested in comparing proportions across, we can use the `position="fill"' argument.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")
```

#### 3. Side-by-side Bar Graphs

When we are interested in comparing counts across groups, we can use the `position="dodge"' argument.

```{r}
# add position="dodge" to your graph above
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```

* When would it be useful to use a graphic like this?
* When might it not be a good choice?  Why?

## Example 2: FiveThiryEight

### A. Read the Article

*"Voter Registrations Are Way, Way Down During the Pandemic"* (Jun 26, 2020) by Kaleigh Rogers and Nathaniel Rakich

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic/


### B. Discuss in Small Groups

1. How are graphics used to tell the authorâ€™s story?

2. What geometries are used?

### C. The Data

What does the raw data look like?

```{r}
# Import data
vreg<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/voter-registration/new-voter-registrations.csv",
               header=TRUE)


head(vreg)

```

### D. Processing the Data

#### Relevel

Relevel the data so that its in the right order:

```{r}
# Level the Month variable so that its in the right order (ie not alphabetical)
vreg$Month<-factor(vreg$Month,
                   levels=c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May"))

```


#### Tidy

```{r}
### USE spread() FROM tidyr
vregYear<-vreg%>%
  spread(Year, New.registered.voters)

### RENAME THE COLUMNS
colnames(vregYear)<-c("Jurisdiction", "Month", "Y2016", "Y2020")


```


#### Mutate

Add change in registration.

```{r}
### mutate() FROM dplyr()
vregChange<-vregYear%>%
  mutate(change=Y2020-Y2016)

```


### E. Recreate the graphic

```{r}
# type code/answer here

```

#### Other hints
* You can add another column to define color
* Pay careful attention to the axes, you might want to read the help file for facet_wrap
