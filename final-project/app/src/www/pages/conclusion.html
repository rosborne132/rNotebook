            </header>

            <p>At BeanSprouts, we’ve always believed that every pet deserves the best care, and every pet owner deserves peace of mind. Our success in the U.S. is a testament to this commitment, and now, we’re ready to take the next step: bringing our trusted pet insurance to Europe, starting with the United Kingdom.</p>

            <h3>The Big Idea</h3>

            <p>Expanding into a new market isn’t just about reaching new customers; it’s about doing it the right way. By taking the time to reassess pet insurance pricing based on breed-specific claim trends, we can optimize premiums to attract more customers and stay competitive in the European market, while failing to do so risks losing market share to better-priced alternatives.</p>
